# Road Map

### First you have to setup infrastructure with [case.sh](https://github.com/devk8sops/case/tree/master/infrastructure) script. 

### Second you can deploy postgresql and redis via [jenkins pipeline](https://github.com/devk8sops/case/tree/master/application).

### After that you can use [redis](https://github.com/devk8sops/case/tree/master/application/redis) and [postgresql](https://github.com/devk8sops/case/tree/master/application/postgresql) health check scripts for health check.
